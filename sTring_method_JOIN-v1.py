"""
The .join() method requires an iterable (such as a Python list) as an argument, so its usage looks different from other string methods:
"""
moon_facts = ["The Moon is drifting away from the Earth.", "On average, the Moon is moving about 4cm every year."]
print(moon_facts)
print(' '.join(moon_facts))
